# Google-Playstore-Data-Analysis
Data Collection: Obtain the dataset containing Google Play Store data. You can find such datasets on platforms like Kaggle or directly from Google's Play Store API.

Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data. This might include:

Summary statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
Distribution of app categories.
Distribution of app ratings.
Relationship between app size and ratings.
Relationship between app price and ratings.
Distribution of app installs.
Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, etc., to visualize the findings from the EDA. Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are commonly used for visualization.

Sentiment Analysis: Analyze user reviews to understand the sentiment towards different apps. You can use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for text processing and sentiment analysis.

Predictive Modeling (Optional): If you're interested in predictive analysis, you can build a model to predict app ratings based on features such as app size, price, category, etc. This could involve techniques like linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.

Conclusion: Summarize your findings and insights from the analysis. What patterns did you observe? Were there any surprising discoveries?

Documentation and Presentation: Document your analysis process, including code, findings, and visualizations. You might also create a presentation to communicate your results effectively.
